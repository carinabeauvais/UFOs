# UFOs

## Overview
The goal is to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings.

### Results
To utilize this page, simply fill in one of the filter features based on city, state, country or shape to filter the data to show what you would like to see.
For example, if we wanted to look at all UFO sightings that were shaped like a circle we would fill in the shape to show circle and filter the data to get the following result:

#### Summary
One drawback of this webpage is that we had to define the columns and rows manually and to update the page you have to hit the Enter key.

A couple of other recommendations for further development of this page would be:
1. Utilize additional filters to further sort the data by regions or multiple states or a date range.
2. Create tables that include filters but also take in additional parameters, like utilizing check boxes to show commonalities among the data.
